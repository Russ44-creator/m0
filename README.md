## Summary
> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered

My implementation comprises `9` software components, totaling `340` lines of code in the following languages: `140` lines of shell scripts and `200` of JavaScript code. Key challenges included `<3 challenges and how you managed to overcome them>`.

## Correctness & Performance Characterization
> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation

*Correctness*: My implementation passes `10` out of the `10` tests (`100`%) already provided for M0. I developed another `<number>` tests, which focus on `<..details>`. All these tests, combined take `<time>` to complete. `<additional approaches for increasing correctness confidence>`.

*Performance*: Evaluating the entire system using the `time` command on the three sandboxes reports the following times:

|           | Engine   | Query    |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| Sandbox 1 | `<time>` | `<time>` |
| Sandbox 2 | `<time>` | `<time>` |
| Sandbox 3 | `<time>` | `<time>` |

## Time to Complete
> Roughly, how many hours did this milestone take you to complete?

Hours: `20`

## Wild Guess
> How many lines of code do you think it will take to build the fully distributed, scalable version of your search engine? (If at all possible, try to justify your answer â€” even a rough justification about the order of magnitude is enough)

DLoC: `10k lines of JavaScript Code`
